## Reader and Writer
#

This is a really simple script to read file names and write to a text file.

## Why did i do this project?

Well, I had to write the name of several database files (more than 400) in a text file, so to automate this task I made this script.

## How to use

You must make a small change in the code, in line 6 you must enter the path to the directory you want the script to read the name of the files and put in a txt file.

If you want to change the name of the txt file that will be generated, just change the first parameter in line 10.

After making changes, just open your terminal and run the command ```python3 script.py```

I hope this script had been helpful to you.
